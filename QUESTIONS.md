# QUESTIONS

- Dog food is typically sold by the lb. Should final value be rounded up?
- Since dog food is sold by the bag, would an additional parameter for how many lbs of food per bag be useful? This could help prevent the user from miscalculating how many bags are needed for the order.
- Option to specify Unit of Measure is not specified. Should we assume US as dog weight is in lbs?  
- Month needs to be defined as number of days in a month can differ.  
- We do not take into account the fluctuation of the amount of dogs in the shelter due to adoptions and intake.
